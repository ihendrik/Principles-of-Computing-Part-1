## Mini Project 01 - Merge function for 2048 game.
For this assignment, you will implement a function merge(line) that models the process of merging all of the tile values in a single row or column. This function takes the list line as a parameter and returns a new list with the tile values from line slid towards the front of the list and merged. Note that you should return a new list and you should not modify the input list. This is one of the more challenging parts of implementing the game.

## Mini Project 02 - Clone of 2048 game.
There are 3 phases that need to be done for this Mini Project

## Mini Project 03 - Monte Carlo Tic-Tac-Toe Player
Using given template and devined variable (TTTBoard, provided, etc) to create a Tic Tac Toe game. Create the AI using Monte Carlo Algorithm.

## Mini Project 04 -
